## densitysplit --- characterization of density-dependent galaxy clustering

### requirements

  - `nbodykit`
  - `numpy`

### Installation

Under the main directory, install the package with `python setup.py install`. 

### Usage

The easiest way to run the pipeline is through the stand-alone code provided in the `bin` directory, which takes a `params.yaml` configuration file as an input. Alternatively, you can import the code as a Python package and run individual parts of the pipeline, which is more suitable if you need to run the code on several simulations. Usage examples are shown in the `examples` directory.
